My Personal Website

This is a personal website to serve as my portfolio.

It includes some general information about me, my skills set, and my projects.

There is also a contact page where you can reach me directly on my email. In case you have any questions or concerns, you can reach me using the contact page. For instance, you may find something that needs to be fixed on the website, you may have a better solution/design for a particular field, or you may need my resume. Feel free to reach me
