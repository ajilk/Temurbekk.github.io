        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I am and always been a huge fan of building. This includes bilding figures using lego pieces, building
            projects from scratch using nothing but lines of code, shooting photos of different moments, or even drawing
            something on the paper using a pencil. </p>
        <p>My passion for building has always been my main source of motivation.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="location-section">
        <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
        <p>I am originally from Samarkand, Uzbekistan.</p>
        <p>I moved to United States when I was 16 and it opened many doors that would be closed to me if I chose to stay
            in country.</p>

    <section class="questions-section">
        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
        <p>My favorite hobbies are taking photos of the environment, spending time with my loved ones, and creating new
            things.</p>
        <h2>What motivated you to become a programmer?</h2>
        <p>I was always a big fan of tinkering with my computer ever since I remember myself.
            I used to play around with software at hand-- My first PC(Personal Computer) had software like Photoshop,
            VideoStudio, and much more.
            Although, i did not know what I was doing and there was no one to teach me this stuff,
            I would just open the software and play around with images and videos until I got something that looks good.
        </p>
        <h2>What would you recommend someone who just started programming?</h2>
        <p>I am far from calling myself someone who has been in this field for a long time. I am a newcomer just like
            most of us. But one piece of advice that I would like to spread is to "Just do it."
            Many people make it sound like Programming is the hardest thing in the world. If they taught kids
            programming from early age like they teach English,
            we would all be programmers. It is about dedication and believing in yourself</p>
        <h2>Where did you learn programming?</h2>
        <p>I learned programming from many places and platforms. I first started programming in my freshman year in
            college. I found it extremely difficult because of the syntax and all the small errors I couldnt figure out.
            But I started learning on my own using platforms like <a href="Youtube.com">YouTube.com</a>, <a
                href="Udemy.com">Udemy.com</a>, <a href="Codecademy.com">Codecademy.com</a>, and my FRIENDS.
